    ephemeral vpn summoned

                VPN type: IPSEC/L2TP PSK
    Pre-shared key (PSK): unknown impish shorten downtown
                Username: mcfly
                Password: baton loony paycheck obituary

```

ephemvpn is implemented in *python* with
*[boto](http://code.google.com/p/boto)* and *[fabric](http://fabfile.org/)*.
Amazon's EC2 is the only supported cloud provider at this time (patches
welcome).

## Setup

### 1. Python

Requires Python 2.7 and virtualenv

Create your virtualenv then:

```bash
    $ source your/virtenv/bin/activate
    $ git clone https://github.com/Ramblurr/ephemvpn.git
    $ cd ephemvpn
    $ pip install -e .
```

(TODO: submit to pypi?)

### 2. EC2

1. A valid AWS account with API and Secret Keys is required.
2. Create a SSH Key Pair for each region(s) which will be used to store AMIs and run instances.
3. Copy the private key to your local machine's "ssh" directory (~/.ssh on Linux), don't forget to chmod 600 it

### 3. Config

Create `~/.ephemvpnrc` with your credentials, unless you want to specify them on
the command line every time

Finally, `$ ephemvpn` to summon a vpn.

## TODO & Known Issues

* Audit ipsec config
* Add Openvpn
* Generate keypair for user ([ctrl+f create_keypair here](http://boto.s3.amazonaws.com/ref/ec2.html))
